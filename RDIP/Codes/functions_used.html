	<h1>FUNCTIONS USED IN UNIT4-</h1>
<ul>
  <li>We need to use button as navigation bar menu for introduction, theory, objective, experiment, quizzes, and procedure.</li>
  <li>In experiment, we have to create a button for selecting languages.</li>
  <li> A dropdown list containing two languages i.e., English and Hindi are displayed.</li>
  <li>In experiment there are two sections one where the jumbled words appear and one where the formed sentences appears.</li>
  <li>Now select each button such that on selecting or clicking each button, the respective word disappears from jumbles section and comes down to the formed sentence section.</li>
  <li>Another facility is given with a button called reform sentence. This is used to reform the sentence again such that the words should go to their previous positions.</li>
  <li>Until the last word is selected, another button i.e. check the correctness of the sentence should not be visible.</li>
  <li>If the answer is correct then a message should be displayed which says "Correct Answer", otherwise "wrong answer is displayed. And along with wrong answer message a button is displayed such that after clicking it correct answers should be displayed.</li>
</ul>
